# Accessing an Enterprise API endpoint with PowerApps and API App Integration

The purpose of this demo is to showcase the ability of how PowerApps platform can help unlock the potential of untapped assets within an Enterprise ( legacy APIs, data sources, processes) with a low-code / no code approach

To demonstrate this ability as a Hands-on experience, we will set-up an environment with the below sample architecture

This set-up requires the below components as the building blocks. 

a) API App instances for the PowerApp integration 

b) API App instance for mocking the Enterprise API

c) Azure Key Vault - This holds the API Key updated by an admin as a Secret

d) Power App Custom Connector
